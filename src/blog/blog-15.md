When we think about autonomous vehicles (AVs), it’s easy to first think of all the amazing advancements that have been made in the field. Less often, we address the underlying problems with AVs: what happens in the case of a crash?

When a human is driving a car, it’s easy to consider the ethical implications. Should I hit the squirrel, or swerve onto the sidewalk where there are several pedestrians? This is an easy choice, and it would also be easy to tell that to an AV: prioritize human life over that of animals. But what about when the scenario becomes more complex? What if the AV has to choose between a grandmother or young child’s life? To decide whether to save ten people and sacrifice the driver, or just save the driver? AVs aside, these are hard decisions for humans to make. So, if we can’t come to an agreement, how can we begin to think about universalizing ethics for AVs? Figures such as Barack Obama and Bill Ford have suggested that the best outcome may indeed be to sacrifice the driver. However, Christoph von Hugo, Mercedes’s manager of driverless car safety, believes that “[i]f you know you can save at least one person, at least save that one. Save the one in the car”.

When dealing with ethical decision making, we could come up with every possible scenario and decide how the AV should respond, ensuring that they would behave the same way every time. We could teach them morals or how to value saving the maximum amount of lives. AVs also have the benefit of being able to make millions of calculations in a very, very short period of time. However, this doesn’t answer the question of how to program cars to decide something that we humans can’t even decide upon. Furthermore, leaving this discretion up to the driver, or car manufacturer, would make these ethical decisions unfair. If Mercedes is the only car brand that prioritizes the driver’s life, then Mercedes owners will have a very unfair advantage over other drivers. If AVs are programmed to make such ethical decisions, it should be universalized, because that’s the only way it’s fair for everyone. 

There are still a lot of factors to consider when allowing AVs to make ethical decisions. However, I think that holding all AVs to the same standards is a good place to start.
