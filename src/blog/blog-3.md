Much like a company or product, an Open Source Software (OSS) project needs a good name. However, what determines a good name? According to <a href="https://producingoss.com/en/getting-started.html#starting-from-what-you-have">this article</a>, which talks about what is needed to start an OSS project, a name is one of the most important things a project has to decide on. It’s the first impression that users have of the software, and can have an effect on engagement with the project, especially in the beginning when trying to recruit contributors. 

So, what makes a good name?

<li>Gives an idea about what the software does</li>
<li>Easy to remember</li>
<li>Unique</li>
<li>Available as a website domain and/or social media handles</li>

<br />

After looking at a lot of different OSS projects, I wonder if they’ve seen this simple list for name requirements. Many of them are short (so, relatively easy to remember), but not many actually describe what their project does. For example, I’d have no idea what **ito** or **Matomo** do without looking at their website. However, it seems like once an OSS gets big enough, it doesn’t really matter what their name is. **Bootstrap** and **Django**, for example, are two popular open source web frameworks. The names are memorable but not descriptive. This seems to be working out fine for them now that they’re well-known; nobody questions why they chose their names.

<br />

So, does a name really matter? Unless it’s really horrible, no. And even if it is, it becomes well-known, or in the worst case, it can be changed. I’d think that after a project becomes established it couldn’t be renamed, but take <a href="https://www.workforce.com/news/globoforce-renames-itself-as-workhuman">this company</a> as an example: they changed their name from Globoforce to Workhuman after 20 years. A few months after renaming, they were evaluated at over $1 billion—so clearly, <a href="https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2020/0623/1149049-workhuman-unicorn-status/">they’re doing okay</a>. And if that’s what we’re comparing OSS to, then I think it’s fine to rename an OSS project as well. So once more, what’s in a name? Apparently, not too much.
