The song Rockin’ Robin was released in 1958. You may have heard it before:

Well, to my surprise, this song is actually in the public domain! I have always heard that works go into public domain 70 years after a creator’s death. However, even if Bobby Day died the year he released the song, it wouldn’t go into public domain until 2028. So why is it in the public domain?

We’ll investigate what public domain is, and how something can enter public domain.

<br />

###### What is public domain?
Public domain is creative materials that are not protected by individual property; for example, a copyright or patent. Instead of the creator owning the copyright to the work, the public owns it. Anyone may use something in the public domain without receiving permission. However, no one person can ever own it. So, you can’t just find something in the public domain and decide you want to copyright it as your original material.

<br />

###### How does something enter the public domain?

There are four main ways that something can enter the public domain, which I'l explain below:

<li>Copyright expires</li>
<li>Copyright owner didn’t renew their copyright</li>
<li>Copyright owner decides to place it in the public domain</li>
<li>Copyright law doesn’t protect this</li>

<br />

**The copyright expires.** For all works published before 1977, the copyright expires 95 years after it was published. So as of this year, 2020, all works published before 1925 are in the public domain. For works published after 1977, the copyright expires 70 years after the author’s death. So for example, even though Michael Jackson is dead, his songs cannot be used until 2079 (70 years after his death).

**The copyright owner didn’t renew their copyright.** This only applies to works published before 1964. The work had to be renewed during the 28th year after publication, and if that wasn’t done, the work became public domain. This is what happened with the song Rockin’ Robin—it was copyrighted in 1958 but it was not renewed. Therefore, while the audio recording is not in public domain, the song itself is, so anyone can make a cover of the song without getting permission.

**The copyright owner decides to place it in the public domain.** This is known as dedication. When someone creates something, they have the option to place it under many different licenses, such as GNU GPL, MIT, or Apache License. These licenses protect works in different ways. However, instead of choosing a license to protect the work, the creator can instead go through the process of placing it in the public domain. Only the creator may make this dedication, and it is a legal process as opposed to just stating which license applies to the work.

**Copyright law doesn’t protect this work.** Put simply, copyright law just doesn’t cover some things. This can be the title of a book or movie, a common phrase, or facts and ideas. For example, the phrase “make my day” is not copyrighted, while “innovation that excites”, Nissan’s slogan, is trademarked and therefore protected by copyright law. Likewise, the fact that a comet will pass by the Earth in 2027 cannot be copyrighted—it is a fact.

<br />

So Rockin’ Robin actually doesn’t fall under the ’70 years after death’ copyright rule. It was an unfortunate case of forgetting to renew the copyright. However, this rule has since been changed, so creators don’t have to worry about it. Now we do just have to wait 70 years until after their death. I wonder if we’ll be hearing covers of Thriller in commercials in 2079...
