Aren’t free software and open source software (OSS) the same thing? After a 45 minute class discussion between intelligent computer science majors, the answer still wasn’t crystal clear. After consulting many online sources, I’ve gotten a better idea of the differences between these types of software. 

Let’s talk break down free software and OSS into basic definitions, then talk about why there’s confusion in the first place.

<br />

###### Free software
At a first glance, ‘free software’ makes you think… Free. No cost. Cool! However, the free software movement was started by Richard Stallman on the premise that users should have complete control over the software they’re using. So free software is free as in ‘free speech’, not ‘free beer’. In Stallman’s mind, users should have the right to run, study, change, and distribute the software they are using. 

It is also worth noting that free software may not necessarily be zero-cost. However, since users are free to distribute as they please, this is essentially meaningless. One person would be able to distribute copies for free, essentially rendering it as zero-cost software.

###### Open source software
OSS is essentially the same as free software. Users can distribute it as they please, and have access to the source code. However, there are differences in the ideologies of free software and OSS. OSS rebranded itself partially because people misunderstood the meaning of free software, and partially as a way to better market the software. They believe that companies are more willing to buy OSS software than ‘free software’. So in essence, yes, free software and OSS are achieving the same things. They just do them for different reasons.

OSS also encourages collaboration, and many OSS projects have contributions from many different developers or community members.

Like free software, OSS is also not necessarily free of charge.

###### Freeware
After looking more into free software vs OSS, I came across the term ‘freeware’. This is now typically used to describe software that is free of cost. An example of this would be Skype: it is free to use, but you cannot access the source code (like you would be able to with free software).

###### Reflection
I think it’s interesting that the term ‘free software’ was chosen in the first place. While I understand why, and it makes sense when explained, there is clearly a lot of ambiguity around the word free to begin with. I think it would have been great if Stallman would have chosen a different term to describe the movement for free software. However, I’m happy that I came across the term ‘freeware’. I think using this exclusively to describe zero-cost software would eliminate a lot of confusion.

I also was under the impression that the entire free software movement renamed itself to be OSS. However, this was simply a derivation of the free software movement. In this text they state that “open source was created as an alternative to ‘free'”, which led me to believe that the movement was just renamed—this is not the case (although it would make a lot more sense). As discussed above, OSS became a software type of its own. And while free software and OSS achieve basically the same things, they do it for different moral reasons.

It’s interesting that OSS even developed in the first place—when we talk about companies not wanting to buy free software, it can be a confusing notion at first. However, imagine being told that a software you’re looking at is ‘free software’. Then, imagine you’re asked to fork over $49.99 per month for this “free” software. Confusing, right? So it makes sense that OSS was formed. They’re still achieving the same notion of free source code while simultaneously encouraging companies to be willing to pay for the software they develop.
