COVID-19 hit the world like a storm, and suddenly companies had to send their employees home to work remotely. So suddenly, that some people didn’t even have a chance to get their things—<a href=" https://www.distractify.com/p/security-guards-office-plants">like at this office</a>. Six months later, unable to return to the office because of the unrelenting pandemic, companies are still struggling with the challenges of working from home. However, some companies have been remote for years. So how do they manage remote work? 

GitLab, a git repository manager, has been 100% remote since it was founded in 2014. Unsurprisingly, they use the same tools that their platform is established upon to create a productive, efficient remote workspace.


How does GitLab do it?

<li>Distribute work modularly</li>
<li>Let employees work independently</li>
<li>Ongoing (public) communication</li>
<li>Using the “git” workflow in real life</li>

<br />

###### The git workflow
The git workflow is a type of version control. Put as simply as possible: a programmer forks the code, makes any edits, and then makes a request to merge their new code back into the master copy. Code is checked to make sure everything is fine before merging with the new copy, and then it’s published. Everyone has access to the master copy at all times, and when there are edits, other programmers have access to them as well. Also, at any point, the project can be reverted to a previous version—hence, version control.

So why is this good for remote work? For starters, it doesn’t require much (if any) synchronous communication. When someone merges their code, they append a description with what changes they made. Anyone else working on the code has a log of all the past changes that have been made, which is marked up to show exactly what lines have been changed. 

Second, having all the code available to the entire workforce is incredibly advantageous. In large companies, small tasks can take days or weeks because of all the hoops you have to jump through getting approval: talking to department X, realizing you actually needed to talk to department Y, getting told that you ALSO need approval from department Z, etc… When everyone has access to the code, everyone is included and knows what is going on at all times.

Third, this type of workflow is good because it encourages the principle of “minimum viable change”. Because it’s so easy to commit the code at any point, employees are encouraged to do this early and often. This prevents someone working on the wrong thing, or a mistake being undetected until the final product. Anyone can frequently check in on work to make sure no time or effort is being wasted.

<br />

The git workflow was developed around code. Version control makes it easy to collaborate with a team because the code is available to everyone, the history of the project is easy to see and revert to, and the ability to branch and merge code promotes independent work. But what if this process was applied to other industries? With public communication, it would be easy to get answers, fast. The principle of “minimum viable change” would prevent work from getting done twice. And with company information available to everyone, nobody would be left in the dark about how their project relates to the company’s goals and current direction, or have to jump through as many hoops to get information. 

Considering how many companies are still operating remotely, I think adopting aspects of the git workflow could be incredibly beneficial to increase productivity and counteract the negative aspects of working remotely.
