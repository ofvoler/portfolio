Hi, and welcome to my first blog post! If you're all the way back here, you may be wondering why a computer science major is writing a blog. Well, wonder no longer:

<br />

###### The premise
This blog is being created for my senior capstone course at Dickinson College. I'm a computer science major and math minor and this yearlong course is required as part of the computer science major.

I will be creating reflective posts on reading and discussion topics related to:

<li>Free and open source software (FOSS)</li>
<li>Software engineering</li>
<li>Contemporary social and ethical issues in technology</li>

<br />

###### The plan
You may have noticed that this blog is actually nestled in a portfolio website featuring mainly visual design. I'm interested in a career that deals with how technology intersects with the design world. I’m not sure yet what career that will be, but some of the fields that currently intrigue me are:

<li>UX/UI design</li>
<li>Graphic design</li>
<li>Front-end development</li>
<li>Product management</li>

<br />

I hope that my education in computer science and math, combined with my internship experience in graphic design and UX/UI design, will allow me to find a career that lets me combine design and technology!
