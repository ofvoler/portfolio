Incremental, or iterative, development is a method of software development that builds on what has been done before. In this form of development, projects are build in small phases. Each iteration is built on, or incremented, as time goes on. Because of this, the development process is more fluid, and requirements change as time passes. Developers can learn from what was done in the previous stage and use it for the next part of the project. This method is in contrast to the Waterfall methodology, which is a linear approach to development. However, forms of incremental design, such as the Agile methodology, are newer and tend to be more popular than the Waterfall methodology. We’ll investigate two types of incremental design and when each one might be useful.

<br />

###### Agile
Agile software development is a group of methodologies based on iterative development. The project is divided into small categories called “sprints”, where each sprint has its own duration and set of deliverables. At the end of each sprint, work is assessed by the team and customers, and that feedback is incorporated into the next sprint. There is a high level of customer involvement and the project is adapted after each sprint, so typically development has a better final product and can be completed faster than one that is made in a linear fashion.

###### Incremental Development & Design
Incremental Development and Design (ID&D), pioneered by Max Kanat-Alexander, is a development process in which each part of the project is implemented one by one—another type of development that increments a little at a time. As each new component is added, the system is refactored to look like it was originally designed to do exactly that. Because of this, it provides a useful service as fast as possible; after implementing each component the system functions on its own and works perfectly with just that. This also means that only the necessary code is written at each step, and the code is easy to change.

<br />

Both Agile and ID&D are forms of incremental/iterative development and therefore create products very rapidly. They both build the most important parts of the projects first so that can serve as a base for the rest of the functionality. By iterating upon what has already been created, the final product is well thought out and developed quickly. Agile is great because it is widely supported, and even has subsets such as Scrum. There is a manifesto to follow and it is 100% team-oriented. ID&D is beneficial in that the project always looked like it was designed for exactly that point, so the code is perfectly tailored to the intended design. This makes it incredibly easy to build on layer.

Compared to the Waterfall methodology, which can be slow and create products that are hard to change, Agile and ID&D are both great forms of rapid development that create good products quickly.
