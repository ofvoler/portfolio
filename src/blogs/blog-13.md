At the beginning my senior capstone course, I was hesitant in my abilities to contribute to an open source project. “How will I ever learn what the code does? What will I do to help contribute? How do I use git??” Although I was worried, without knowing it, I was preparing to contribute from day 1.

After our first class discussion, I was still confused about the difference between free and open source software. I didn’t think it was relevant and wrote my blog based on our exact discussion as an attempt to understand. However, I found that when I invested more time into the readings and did them earlier, I had more time to ponder the material and was then more prepared to discuss. As the blogs went on, I got more and more curious about how our discussions and reading related to other topics. I tried to explore what I was interested in as much as possible, and often got lost in a rabbit hole of reading article after article of interesting topics. I found that when I approached the blogs with a sense of curiosity, I learned so much more and got so much more out of them as well.

One of my main worries was using git. GitHub confused me to begin with, and while the interactive rebase tutorial that we did was fun, I was concerned that I wouldn’t be able to apply it. I think that was one of my main fears all semester and led to me not wanting to do a code contribution. I was constantly confused with whether my code was updated, if my branch had been pushed to origin, or how I could see the most recent commits. Not doing anything about it didn’t help me either. It took my working on my first code issue to really face the unfamiliar head-on, and when I did, I found that I was able to work it out with the help of my Linux notes and Google. I was so nervous to learn something new, but all I had to do was confront my fear of not knowing. That’s a really important thing to know before getting a first job—I won’t always have an assignment description or professor to help me, so I need to confront my fears and insecurities early on and head-first.

Something that I have found so fulfilling this semester is contributing to my project. I started by reaching out to the project organizer, hopeful that I could get one issue. However, I think he could tell that I really wanted to participate, and that I could contribute in ways that nobody else could. This led to a lot of conversation about what role I could play in the project team, and I was almost instantly assigned two issues and given a lot of trust. While design isn’t exactly what a computer science senior seminar is focused on, it’s a type of contribution that is really meaningful to me and also really important to the project. It’s also given me really valuable practice working with cross-functional teams. I always write on my resume that I’m great at communicating with design and tech professionals because I have experience with both, but this has given me real experience and a confidence boost that I will carry with me. I’ve also never had the opportunity to work with someone who has such differing opinions as me. Since the project organizer is approaching this with a very analytical mindset and I’m thinking from a design standpoint, we’ve had some really interesting conversations about what will best serve the project. It’s required a lot of active listening on my end; I’m trying to approach new ideas with an open mind and not just assume that I know best. It’s been a good challenge and has stretched me to really think creatively and adapt to ever-changing requirements.
