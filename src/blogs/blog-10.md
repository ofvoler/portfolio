Scrum is one of the most popular Agile frameworks that has been around for decades. Its value comes in that it helps teams deliver value early and predictable. Scrum is a flexible framework that you can use to adapt to your team’s needs and values, which makes it very powerful and a great way to be productive. We’ve seen that especially in the pandemic: teams that are using Agile frameworks have been able to better adapt to the changing market.

A lot of the focus in Scrum is on the process and the different team members that work together to get things done. But the leader of a Scrum team is also important. The product owner is responsible for maximizing the business value of the team, and the Scrum master facilitates the whole Scrum process. Together, these people play an important role in making sure the team is on track and functioning well.

###### Scrum leadership traits

So what makes a good Scrum leader? An article by The Entrepriser’s project details 9 key signs that a Scrum leader is effective.

<ul>
<li>They walk the walk.</li>
<li>They’ve done their homework</li>
<li>They know which outcomes they want from agility</li>
<li>They invest funding and staff to make it happen</li>
<li>They are visible and active in the journey</li>
<li>They’re able to communicate both progress and opportunity simultaneously</li>
<li>They’re balanced with their power styles</li>
<li>They’re willing to give power to the team</li>
<li>They’re willing to be vulnerable</li>
<li>It’s important to note that a lot of these are qualities of any good leader, not just specifically Scrum. However, what’s really interesting is that we can tie these ideals back to the five Scrum values.</li>
</ul>

###### Scrum leadership and Scrum values

The first Scrum value is **commitment**. We can see this in (2) and (4). If a leader is actively learning and investing in the project (whether that is their time, funding, or staff), the project is more likely to succeed. Also, a leader who is constantly striving to learn more about Agile and Scrum displays their commitment to bettering the team and themselves.

The next value is **focus**, which is demonstrated by (3). By determining what outcomes are important, they’re focusing their team and making sure they stay on track. Having a strong vision as a leader will ensure that the team is also focused.

The value **openness** is demonstrated by (5) and (6). By being active in the team’s journey, they are promoting communication and investing to make sure the team feels supported. Also, a good leader is able to effectively deliver good news while still pointing out what remains. A bad leader may only talk about what needs to be done, which can lead to burnout because the team feels as if they’re not accomplishing a lot.

Next, **courage** is demonstrated by both (7) and (9). Balancing power styles simply means that they are able to both listen and make hard choices, which are both common traits of a leader. Similarly, vulnerability is a great way to show humility while also admitting that they may not always know the answers.

Finally, **respect** can be seen through (1) and (8). ‘Walking the walk’ means that they not only say that they understand Scrum, but demonstrate it as well. By being invested and showing that they truly practice what they’re preaching, this shows respect to the team. Similarly, giving power to the team means that they trust them to get their work done and are empowered to get it done as well.
