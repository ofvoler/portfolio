It’s a well-known fact that there are less women than men in the computing field. Of all computer science jobs, only 25% are women. This becomes more bleak when we look at software engineering jobs; only 14% of these positions are filled by women. Then we look at FOSS projects: only 3% of women are contributors.

Isn’t that sad? While FOSS is great in that it promotes idea sharing and collaboration, it unfortunately brings over a lot of the inequality from the computer science field. Evaluating this as generally as possible, women make less than men. This ultimately leads to women having less time and therefore not being afforded the luxury of contributing to an open source project.

However, when we look deeper than just money, we see that there are a lot of deep-rooted issues in the FOSS community that may also lead to significantly fewer contributions from women than from men. Many men believe that women can’t do what men can, need to be hand-held, are “exceptionally smart” for doing the same things as men, or just can’t be taken seriously. Clearly this shows a lot of disrespect and isn’t encouraging to women that just want to participate. There are also many incidents of harassment and blatant sexism. While this isn’t unique to FOSS projects, it’s another significant barrier to entry or reason for women to stop contributing. Sarah Sharp, a prominent Linux kernel developer who developed the USB 3.0 host controller driver (before any other company, by the way), quit working for Linux because of how poorly she was treated. She loved what she did for Linux, but the environment and toxic interactions were enough to turn her away. This isn’t an isolated incident, either; there are many other testimonies of poor treatment towards women in FOSS.

We can’t immediately correct the sexism and disproportionate ratio of men to women in FOSS, but we can start with encouraging women in any way possible. Nobody can force a woman to join a FOSS project; they’re volunteering their own time. However, project owners and other contributors can encourage women once they’re there. Giving them a space to grow and feel respected is the least that can be done to encourage more women to participate in FOSS and grow more confident as coders and professionals.
