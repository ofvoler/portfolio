As of October 2020, Windows held 76% of the desktop OS market share. This is followed by macOS (18%), unknown operating systems (3%), and finally, Chrome OS and Linux at 1.5% each. However, according to a Stack Overflow developer survey that garnered over 87,000 responses, Linux held 25% of the share—almost a tie with macOS at 26%. So is there something that developers know about operating systems that the general population doesn’t?

It turns out that Linux is actually the best OS for a number of factors, primarily security. However, we’ll also mention a few others, such as reliability and availability.

<br />

###### Security

If you ask experts, Linux is clearly the most secure OS. One of the key factors that contributes to this is that it is open source. While at first glance, you may think that having a ton of contributors would be a detriment, it’s actually why open source is successful. When there are so many other programmers to peer review and spot bugs in the code, bugs are found and fixed easily and quickly. This also means that there are no secrets and no back doors in the code—the entire public can access the code, so any problems will be found and fixed promptly.

###### Reliability

Have you ever had to restart your computer after installing software, or just because it was being slow? This doesn’t happen with Linux. Based on the way that it’s coded, it will run smoothly for a much longer time than another OS. Because of this, tech giants like Google and Facebook run on Linux—in fact, all 500 of the fastest supercomputers in the world run on Linux.

###### Availability

Have you ever had to restart your computer after installing software, or just because it was being slow? This doesn’t happen with Linux.

Because of this, tech giants like Google and Facebook run on Linux—in fact, all 500 of the fastest supercomputers in the world run on Linux.

There are a lot of different perks of using Linux. Ones that weren’t mentioned in their own sections are customization, faster updates, and more privacy. However the biggest benefit to using Linux is its security. Everyone has different needs, so choose the right OS for you. However, the next time your Windows OS crashes or is slow, remember that Linux is always available and free to use!
