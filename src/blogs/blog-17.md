Government surveillance is a tricky subject (I feel like I start every blog like this…). In a lot of ways, it can be used for good: for example, tracking down national threats and providing answers when a crime is committed. However, as with any good technology, there is always potential for malicious, unethical use.

I mentioned briefly in my last blog how the Chinese government is using biometric data to collect information about citizens’ behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. There are good intentions behind this: the government  wants to stop COVID, so they’re using the technology they have to see when people are leaving their houses or not wearing masks. However, they may be taking it a step too far, since they are collecting data without the knowledge of their citizens. A more ethical version of this is contract tracing apps, where users can opt in to sharing their location data to keep track of who they have been in contact with. Another example is contact tracing lists at restaurants, where the host takes down the name and phone number of someone in each party so they can be contacted later if necessary. These two forms of contact tracing are good, but they don’t cover everything. If you don’t opt in to an app and you have COVID, it helps nobody. Once you leave the restaurant, again, you’re on your own. So, like the Chinese government, should we put the advanced surveillance technology that we have to use?

Let’s put it this way: if surveillance can be used effectively to prevent the spread of the virus, should we use it? If there is 100% accurate location data available for every person, should we use that in conjunction with COVID testing results to notify people of if they should quarantine or get tested? In such a huge global catastrophe such as this, my first answer would be a yes. However, there is definitely potential for the data to be used for other purposes. For example, smartphone data from the storming of the capitol in January 2021 was released to the New York Times. This included “100,000 location pings for thousands of smartphones, revealing around 130 devices inside the Capitol exactly when Trump supporters were storming the building”. These people didn’t know that their data was being collected, and there is no legal requirement that the data ever has to be deleted. So while 100% accurate location data could be beneficial to stopping the pandemic, it never has to be deleted and could be used later on for malicious purposes. Is that worth mitigating the spread of the virus? 

There is abundant evidence that surveillance programs tend to stick around much longer than the duration of the emergency that justified them. And indeed, it feels like our privacy is dwindling as time goes on. It’s tempting to use surveillance technology in dire situations like a pandemic, but if we do, will they ever go away?
