We know that there’s bias in our society, whether that’s a machine learning program, judge, or algorithm. Sometimes, that bias isn’t always apparent. However, what happens when it is? Even if there’s an explanation for why the algorithm might behave that way, is it ethical?

<br />

###### Google
In 2016, there were accusations of Google’s image search algorithm being racist. When searching for “three white teenagers”, the results were of teens hanging out in front of a stock background. But when searching for “three black teenagers”, results populated with rows of mugshots. According to <a href="https://splinternews.com/black-teenagers-vs-white-teenagers-why-googles-algori-1793857436">this article</a>, search results depend on a lot of factors, like “[t]he popularity of the image, how frequently it is shared, context such as text around the image, and meta-tagging.” By this logic, it’s up to the users interacting with images to determine which search results come up first. But is that okay? Should Google take responsibility for their racist search results?

<br />

###### Twitter
Another example of bias and racism in mainstream media is Twitter’s image cropping algorithm. There have been many examples of how Twitter crops image previews to show a white person instead of a black person (three sources linked below). As people have pointed out in comments to these tweets, an explanation for this could be that the algorithm prioritizes contrast (source). But, as user <a href="https://twitter.com/MartinMuehl/status/1335958885052641283">@MartinMuehl</a> points out, for every “creative example” you can find where the algorithm prioritizes a black person, “there will be 100 that will show you the racist bias”. The difference between this case and Googe’s search algorithm, though, is that this would be much easier to fix. Twitter could add a feature to let users crop their own image previews and eliminate all of the bias and racism that their algorithm displays. Twitter <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/twitter-to-let-users-crop-their-own-image-previews/383118/">has stated</a> that they intend to allow this, but at this date it has been four months since that article was published and the feature is still not available. So again, is it ethical for Twitter to continue allowing this to happen?

<br />

I will note that now the searches for “three white teenagers” and “three black teenagers” both show results for articles about the racist algorithm. It’s good that at least two search results are less racist, but what about searches like “professional hairstyle” that still feature predominately white people? Should Google monitor their search results more carefully, and should Twitter let users crop their own image previews? It’s hard to tell what the ethical choice is in some cases, but here I think it is pretty clear: we should work to eliminate racism and bias in our algorithms as much as possible.
