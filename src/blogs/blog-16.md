You’ve heard of Amazon. But have you heard of Amazon Go? These in-person grocery and convenience stores, which debuted in 2018 in Seattle, leverage cameras, weight sensors, and artificial intelligence to help customers with the shopping process. When a customer is done shopping, they just leave. No lines, no cashier, no waiting—the systems automatically calculate what’s in the bag and charge it to the Amazon account. 

What’s really amazing is that the store can precisely track everything, even if the customer picks up five bananas, puts back three, and then takes two again. It can distinguish between two people standing next to each other at a shelf and still tell which one grabbed milk and which took orange juice. Amazon started the store as another way to put customers first, and to reduce the time and effort they spend shopping.

While this is a novel concept, it’s a little creepy to think of a grocery store tracking your every move. At least you aren’t being tracked outside the store!

Spoiler alert: tracking is happening outside the store. Let’s take China, for example. Rated the world’s worst offender of invasive biometric data collection, China has adopted widespread use of fingerprinting and facial recognition technology. Anyone who enters China is fingerprinted, and there are no safeguards for privacy for Chinese employees.

Biometric data is a tricky form of authentication. It’s secure, yes, but also raises some ethical concerns—you can’t change your fingerprint like you can a password. If this data is leaked or misused, it could lead to some serious repercussions.  

Let’s go back to China for a minute. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese government increased their use of biometric data. They used drones with facial recognition software to monitor people outside of their homes during lockdown periods, and installed cameras on buses to take people’s pictures and temperatures. In the past, Chinese companies have monitored employees’ brainwaves for productivity and installed “smart cushions” that can take employees’ vital signs. The companies book used this data to tell employees when to get up and stretch. All of these practices of biometric data use are invasive and an infringement on privacy. It’s one thing if a large majority of Chinese citizens agree that this data can be used for the common good, but it’s a whole different story when 90% of Chinese people oppose the use of facial recognition technology. 

Amazon Go and biometric data collection have some things in common, but unfortunately one thing that isn’t consistent is consent. Since biometric data is such a private matter, the use of it should require the person’s consent, or subject should at least have knowledge of the data’s use. Grocery store tracking and biometric data collection have a lot of potential for good, but society needs to be careful with how these technologies are implemented and used.
