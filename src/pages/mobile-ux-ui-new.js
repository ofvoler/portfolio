      <p>Based off of mockups and a test version of the app, create high-fidelity mockups and prototype them, then make the handoff to the developers.</p>

      <p>Provide guidance and feedback on initial versions of the app to ensure that they are following the standards of the mockups.</p>

      The app had already been primitively started when I joined, 
      but the team wanted to restart completely with a new coding language and new UI, 
      so that’s where I was brought in. 
      Here are a few screenshots of the UI before I started: the first two are the very original mockups,
      and the second two are work they were doing just as I began.

      <p>
      Even though the team really liked these logos (especially the ones on the left), 
      the lemon theme that I landed on definitely reminded us of a certain food delivery company. 
      We didn’t want to run into any sort of copyright problems, so I thought of ways to redesign the logo with different fruits:
