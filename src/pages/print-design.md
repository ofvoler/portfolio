Design print assets consistent with company branding to distribute to clients and company stakeholders.

I worked for <a className="portfolioPageLinkStyle" href="https://www.branchfurniture.com/" target="_blank">Branch</a> to create these designs. The first photo is a document about remote hiring that is available for customers to <a href="https://www.branchfurniture.com/pages/guides" target="_blank">download</a> from their website.

The second mockup shows two different pages that are distributed to landlords and brokers of potential clients, letting them know about Branch and their services.
