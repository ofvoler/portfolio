  Hi, welcome to my portfolio!
</h1>

I spent the past two years working on my Wordpress portfolio site, but it's clunky and slow and something needed to change.

Enter: Gatsby!

I'm working on moving my portfolio over to this site, which means:

1. I'm learning React, GraphQL, CSS, JavaScript, git on a Mac, etc...
2. Everything is **so** much easiser to edit
4. It's a static site, so it's faster!

Plus, I've been touting this whole 'developer _and_ designer' thing, so it kind of makes sense...

Anyway, I've been enjoying this process a lot and I hope you enjoy the final product! If you have any comments, helpful feedback, ideas on how to make my code nicer, anything—I'd love to hear it!
